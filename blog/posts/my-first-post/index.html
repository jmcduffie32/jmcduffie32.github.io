<p>This was surprisingly easy. All I had to do was make sure the asciidoctor gem was
installed and use <code>.adoc</code> as the file extension. Hugo already supports asciidoc;
one thing I did find confusing, was that if I wanted to run asciidoctor from the
command line on one of the Hugo files it would fail. Turns out you have to pass
<code>-a skip-front-matter</code> to asciidoctor to tell it to strip out the front matter
section that Hugo uses.</p>

<p>I spoke a little too soon (I&#8217;m writing this post as I get everything set up, bear with me). Getting the block below to format the way I expected was a bit trickier. I needed to first get the exported version of the asciidoctor css file. That wasn&#8217;t too bad. I found a blog post that gave the necessary attribute to get the job done.
Using this attribute, I was able to get a standalone css file that I could then include in my Hugo theme.</p>

<pre class="rouge highlight" style="background-color: #f8f8f8"><code data-lang="bash">asciidoctor <span style="color: #000080">-a</span> linkcss &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I&#8217;m just now getting acquainted with Hugo, I wasn&#8217;t sure how to include a css file. Seems like a simple thing, but I wound up having to rebuild the theme and include it there. I&#8217;m fairly certain there&#8217;s a more correct way of doing this, but for now this works. So with all that out of the way, it&#8217;s time to say "Hello Hugo!".</p>
